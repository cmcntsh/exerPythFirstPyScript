## Steps to complete before tutorial

* If you're on a Windows machine you will need to install Python before this tutorial will work. (Complete the exercise to install Anaconda first. That will install Python on your machine.)
* Open any plain text editor (like Notepad not a word processing application like Word).
* Enter the text `print('hello world')` as shown in the tutorial
* Save the file with the name 'hello.py' (make sure it has the .py file extension at the end not .txt)
